## Custom ESP32 Device Features

Our custom ESP32 Computerddresses specific limitations present in standard ESP32 development boards commonly available in the market. Here's a breakdown of its enhancements:

1. **Increased Memory:** The custom device boasts enhanced memory specifications with 128MB ROM and 64MB RAM, providing substantial improvements over standard development boards. This augmentation ensures smoother operations and accommodates resource-intensive applications, a crucial factor for our targeted use case.

2. **Optimization for Low Power Consumption:** Through meticulous optimization efforts in both software and hardware, our device significantly reduces power consumption without compromising performance. In extensive tests, it successfully operated using a tiny 200mAh battery, sustaining functionality for approximately 3 hours. This translates to an impressive 31-day runtime for a single unit, emphasizing its efficiency and suitability for long-term deployments.

3. **Extended Network Range:** Unlike typical ESP32 development boards with a Wi-Fi range of 50-70 meters, our custom device offers an expanded coverage area of up to 300 meters. This augmented range, supported by both internal and external antenna options, enhances connectivity and usability across larger spaces or challenging environments.

4. **Industry 4.0 Compatibility:** To cater to industrial requirements, our device features an RS485 communication port. This addition facilitates seamless communication with machinery and equipment commonly found in Industry 4.0 setups, enhancing interoperability and integration capabilities.
